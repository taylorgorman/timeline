# Timeline
> Visualize the people, places, and events of your life

This project was fun! But now I use [Airtable](https://airtable.com) to visualize timelines and I have [other](https://github.com/taylorgorman/money-firebase) [neat](https://github.com/taylorgorman/tmdb-stats) [projects](https://github.com/taylorgorman/crapper-keeper) I use to explore dev tools.

RIP, Timeline. It was your time for the end of the line.
